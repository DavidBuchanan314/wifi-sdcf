The flash ROM IC is an W25X40AL (512k)

The WiFi chip is a BCM43362 (the shiny grey one)

The main application processor/MCU is currently unidentified, other than these markings:

```
Ecast 001
G0159E-WQFN48
1421 A0
KCR24186.1
```

Based on the firmware, it looks like it's something 8051 based.

There are some interesting test points on the underside of the board, labeled `IOP2` and `IOP3`. I haven't figured out what these do yet, if anything.
